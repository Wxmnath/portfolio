        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, my names Nathan from Wrexham, North Wales.</p>
        <p>I have been interested with computers when I was young but never had any opportunity to do more than use and play games on. 
            Currently at a stage of my life where I want to do something different, so searched in courses to learn more about computing and coding.
            And that's where I found ManchesterCodes!
        </p>
